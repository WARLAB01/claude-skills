# Genre Craft: Noir, Thriller, Mystery, Suspense, Horror

Conventions, techniques, and blending strategies for the genres you write.

## Genre Definitions & Core Elements

### Mystery
**Core question**: Whodunit? (or Howdunit/Whydunit)
**Structure**: Crime occurs → Investigation → Red herrings → Solution
**Reader experience**: Puzzle-solving alongside protagonist

**Key conventions:**
- Fair play: Reader has access to same clues as detective
- Planting and payoff: Clues seeded early, significance revealed later
- Red herrings: False leads that make sense in retrospect
- The reveal: Satisfying explanation that recontextualizes earlier events

**POV considerations**: Often detective POV; limited knowledge is essential

### Noir
**Core element**: Moral ambiguity and fatalism
**Atmosphere**: Urban decay, shadows, moral compromise
**Reader experience**: Dread, inevitability, sometimes nihilism

**Key conventions:**
- Flawed protagonist: Not a hero, often compromised
- Femme fatale or homme fatal: Attractive danger
- Doomed atmosphere: Things will go wrong
- Social critique: Corruption in institutions
- Voice: First-person cynical narration common
- Ending: Often bleak or pyrrhic victory

**POV considerations**: First-person enhances voice; unreliable narration fits naturally

### Thriller
**Core element**: High stakes + ticking clock
**Structure**: Goal → Escalating obstacles → Climax under pressure
**Reader experience**: Tension, page-turning urgency

**Key conventions:**
- Clear stakes: Readers know what's at risk
- Time pressure: Deadlines create urgency
- Capable protagonist: Skilled but challenged
- Worthy antagonist: Formidable opposition
- Setbacks: Things get worse before resolution
- Action sequences: Physical conflict common

**POV considerations**: Multiple POVs work well; switching to antagonist raises stakes

### Suspense
**Core element**: Anticipation of threat
**Structure**: Threat established → Tension builds → Release (or not)
**Reader experience**: Anxiety, dread, can't look away

**Key conventions:**
- Dramatic irony: Reader knows danger character doesn't
- Slow burn: Tension builds over time
- Vulnerability: Character in jeopardy
- False relief: Moments of safety that don't last
- Atmosphere: Environment contributes to dread

**POV considerations**: Limited POV increases vulnerability; dramatic irony requires careful knowledge management

### Horror
**Core element**: Fear and the uncanny
**Structure**: Normalcy → Intrusion of threat → Confrontation → Aftermath
**Reader experience**: Fear, revulsion, existential unease

**Key conventions:**
- The unknown: Fear of what we don't understand
- Escalation: Threat grows or reveals true nature
- Vulnerability: Characters can't easily escape or defeat threat
- Body: Physical violation or transformation
- Atmosphere: Setting as character
- Cost: Horror extracts a price, even in "victory"

**POV considerations**: Limited POV enhances fear; what we don't see is scarier

## Blending Genres

### Noir + Mystery (Your frequent blend)
**What carries over:**
- Mystery's structure (crime → investigation → solution)
- Noir's atmosphere and moral ambiguity
- Noir's flawed detective replaces the genius detective

**Tensions to manage:**
- Mystery wants satisfying resolution; noir resists tidy endings
- Balance: Solve the crime but leave moral questions open
- The solution can be hollow — knowing who did it doesn't fix anything

**Example approach**: The detective solves the case but is complicit, compromised, or personally destroyed by what they learn.

### Thriller + Mystery
**What works:**
- Mystery's puzzle structure with thriller's pacing
- Time pressure on the investigation
- Stakes beyond "catch the criminal" (bomb, kidnapping, etc.)

**Balance**: Don't sacrifice fair-play clues for action sequences

### Suspense + Horror
**What works:**
- Suspense's slow build leading to horror's reveal
- Atmospheric dread throughout
- The threat can be supernatural or human

**Balance**: Suspense needs a threat that could plausibly materialize; horror can go cosmic/impossible

### Noir + Horror
**What works:**
- Fatalism: Both genres embrace dark endings
- Moral corruption maps to physical/spiritual corruption
- Urban decay meets cosmic indifference

**Example**: Protagonist investigates something that destroys their worldview; the "solution" makes things worse.

## Voice & Prose by Genre

### Mystery Prose
- Clear and observational
- Focus on details that matter
- Character voice filtered through analytical mind
- Dialogue carries exposition naturally

### Noir Prose
- Atmospheric and cynical
- Simile and metaphor heavy (classic noir)
- First-person voice dominant
- Short, punchy sentences mixed with longer internal monologue
- World-weary tone

**Example voice**: *"She had the kind of smile that promised things. Trouble, mostly. I'd seen enough smiles like that to know better. Didn't stop me from sitting down."*

### Thriller Prose
- Propulsive, short chapters
- End scenes on hooks
- Action verbs, minimal introspection during action
- Clarity over style in tense moments

### Suspense Prose
- Slower, building dread
- Sensory details that feel wrong
- Internal monologue focused on fear/anxiety
- Delayed revelations

### Horror Prose
- Visceral when needed, restrained buildup
- The uncanny: familiar things made wrong
- Sensory disgust (sound, smell, texture)
- White space and what's NOT described

## AI Prompt Modifiers by Genre

When drafting in NovelCrafter, add genre-specific instructions:

**For noir scenes:**
```
Write in noir style: cynical voice, atmospheric detail, moral ambiguity.
Avoid: Heroic framing, optimistic tone, simple morality.
```

**For thriller scenes:**
```
Write with thriller pacing: short paragraphs, end on tension, 
clear action beats. Focus on stakes and urgency.
```

**For mystery scenes:**
```
Include observational details that could be clues. 
Plant information fairly — reader should be able to look back and see it.
Avoid: Having the detective notice things the reader can't.
```

**For suspense scenes:**
```
Build dread slowly. Use sensory wrongness. 
The character should feel something is off before confirming it.
Delay the reveal; anticipation is the goal.
```

**For horror scenes:**
```
Less is more — suggest rather than show fully.
Use sensory disgust (sound, smell, texture).
The unknown is scarier than the known.
```
