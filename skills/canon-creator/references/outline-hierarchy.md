## Summarization Guidelines

Use **present tense** at all levels:
- ✓ "Sarah discovers the body"

### Spoiler Policy

Include all spoilers. This is reference documentation, not marketing copy.

### Character Naming

- Use first names for major characters
- Use full names on first mention, then first names
- Use role descriptors for minor characters ("the bartender")

### Causality

Show cause and effect:
- ✓ "Sarah's question angers Marcus, who storms out"
- ✗ "Sarah asks a question. Marcus leaves."

### Emotional Weight

Include emotional stakes, not just events:
- ✓ "Sarah finds the photo, confirming her worst fear"
